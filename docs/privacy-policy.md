Car Confort (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled when you use our mobile application, Car Confort.

### 1. **No Data Collection**

We do not collect, store, or share any personal data or user information. The app functions entirely offline and does not connect to the internet at any point.

### 2. **No Internet Access**

Car Confort does not require or use internet access. All functionality is performed locally on your device.

### 3. **Functionality**

The app’s purpose is to facilitate communication between Android Auto and a Bluetooth background service on your device. This operation is entirely local and does not involve any data transmission to external servers.

### 4. **Permissions**

To comply with Android and Google Play requirements for Bluetooth device scanning, Car Confort requests **location permission** (e.g., ACCESS\_COARSE\_LOCATION or ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION). This permission is **strictly** used to discover and connect to nearby Bluetooth accessories; we **do not** use it to determine or record your geographic location, nor do we collect, store, or share any location data.

### 5. **Third-Party Access**

Since the app does not collect or transmit any data, no third-party service providers or external entities have access to your information.

### 6. **Changes to This Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app or through the appropriate app store page.
